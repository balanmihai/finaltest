      <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
      <p>Hi there, I’m Tudor Monroe, music producer, multi-instrumentalist, artist and entrepreneur. From as early as I can remember I’ve been immersed in music. I began my journey as a professional musician when I was 12 years old, playing classical guitar while attending a music-based middle school in Brasov, Romania. Continuing my development as a multi-instrumentalist, I branched into piano and bass, all the time playing with a range of local bands. My focus shifted from performing to the composition and production of music while still at high school when I began to produce RnB and Pop music. 
      </p>
